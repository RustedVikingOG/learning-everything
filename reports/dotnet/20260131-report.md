# .NET & C# Learning Progress Report

**Student:** Viking  
**Effective Time Spent:** ~4 hours  
**Topic:** Introduction to .NET Web API Development

---

## Objectives Completed ✅

- [x] Install .NET SDK
- [x] Scaffold a new Web API project
- [x] Run the API and hit an endpoint

---

## Environment Setup

| Component | Version/Details |
|-----------|-----------------|
| .NET SDK | 10.0.102 (LTS) |
| OS | macOS |
| IDE | VS Code with C# Dev Kit |
| Terminal | zsh |

**Key Learning:** Understood the difference between SDK (development tools + runtime) and Runtime (execution only). Recognized that SDK installations are system-wide, requiring elevated permissions for updates.

---

## Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Project Scaffolding
- Successfully used `dotnet new webapi -n first-dotnet-webapi` to generate a project
- Identified the `.csproj` file as the equivalent of `package.json` in Node.js
- Recognized that `obj/` contains generated files (similar to `node_modules/`)

### 2. C# Language Fundamentals

**Records:**
- Understood that `record` is a data structure (not a method/interface)
- Correctly identified that records can have computed properties
- Example understood:
  ```csharp
  record WeatherForecast(DateOnly Date, int TemperatureC, string? Summary)
  {
      public int TemperatureF => 32 + (int)(TemperatureC / 0.5556);
  }
  ```

**Type Safety:**
- Identified typed parameters: `int`, `string?`, `DateOnly`
- Understood nullable types (`string?`)

### 3. ASP.NET Core Routing

**Minimal API Pattern:**
- Understood `MapGet("/route", handler)` maps HTTP GET requests to handlers
- Connected this to Express.js/Fastify patterns from prior experience

### 4. LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
- Correctly interpreted `Enumerable.Range(1, 5).Select(...)` as equivalent to JavaScript's `[1,2,3,4,5].map(...)`
- Understood method chaining with `.ToArray()`

### 5. API Testing
- Successfully ran the API with `dotnet run`
- Tested endpoint using `curl`
- Correctly predicted that repeated requests return different data due to `Random.Shared.Next()`

---

## Problem-Solving Demonstrated

1. **Typo Recovery:** Caught and corrected `dotner` → `dotnet` independently
2. **Permissions Handling:** Used `sudo` when workload update required elevated privileges
3. **Curl Syntax:** Recovered from incorrect curl syntax and still achieved the goal
4. **Self-directed Discovery:** Found official .NET documentation at dotnet.microsoft.com independently

---

## Connections to Prior Knowledge

The student effectively leveraged experience with:
- **Python** - Package management concepts
- **Node.js/Express** - Server setup patterns, routing
- **TypeScript** - Type annotations, interfaces vs concrete types
- **Vue.js** - Entry point file structure (compared `Program.cs` to `App.vue`)

---

## Areas for Continued Learning

- HTTPS certificate trust (`dotnet dev-certs https --trust`)
- Adding custom endpoints with route parameters
- Deeper exploration of LINQ
- Understanding the `builder` pattern and dependency injection
- Project structure (`Properties/`, `appsettings.json`)

---

## Assessment

### Understanding Level

| Objective | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Install .NET SDK | ✅ Strong | Found docs independently, understood SDK vs Runtime distinction, handled permissions correctly |
| Scaffold a new Web API project | ✅ Strong | Successfully ran command, identified .csproj as package.json equivalent, explored generated files |
| Run the API and hit an endpoint | ✅ Strong | Ran server, tested with curl, understood the JSON response and why values change |

### Concerns

None. The student demonstrated solid understanding of all core objectives and was able to connect new concepts to prior knowledge effectively. Initial confusion about records (thinking they were methods) was quickly corrected through guided questioning.

---

## Summary

Strong first session with .NET. The student shows excellent ability to:
- Transfer knowledge from other frameworks
- Ask clarifying questions
- Debug independently
- Understand concepts through guided discovery rather than rote copying

**Recommended Next Steps:** Add a custom endpoint with a route parameter (e.g., `/hello/{name}`) to reinforce routing concepts.
