# .NET & C# Learning Progress Report

**Student:** Viking  
**Effective Time Spent:** ~4 hours  
**Topic:** Introduction to .NET Web API Development  
**Lesson:** 01 - Web API Basics  
**Milestone:** 1 - REST API Foundation *(29% complete after this session)*

---

## Session Context

**Previous Session:** First session  
**Capstone Goal:** Build a real-time chat application (WebChat) demonstrating full-stack .NET development  
**This Session's Role:** Establishing foundation—project scaffolding, understanding the runtime, and basic routing patterns that all future API work builds upon

---

## Objectives Completed ✅

- [x] Install .NET SDK
- [x] Scaffold a new Web API project
- [x] Run the API and hit an endpoint

---

## Environment Setup

| Component | Version/Details |
|-----------|-----------------|
| .NET SDK | 10.0.102 (LTS) |
| OS | macOS |
| IDE | VS Code with C# Dev Kit |
| Terminal | zsh |

**Key Learning:** Understood the difference between SDK (development tools + runtime) and Runtime (execution only). Recognized that SDK installations are system-wide, requiring elevated permissions for updates.

---

## Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Project Scaffolding
- Successfully used `dotnet new webapi -n first-dotnet-webapi` to generate a project
- Identified the `.csproj` file as the equivalent of `package.json` in Node.js
- Recognized that `obj/` contains generated files (similar to `node_modules/`)

### 2. C# Language Fundamentals

**Records:**
- Understood that `record` is a data structure (not a method/interface)
- Correctly identified that records can have computed properties
- Example understood:
  ```csharp
  record WeatherForecast(DateOnly Date, int TemperatureC, string? Summary)
  {
      public int TemperatureF => 32 + (int)(TemperatureC / 0.5556);
  }
  ```

**Type Safety:**
- Identified typed parameters: `int`, `string?`, `DateOnly`
- Understood nullable types (`string?`)

### 3. ASP.NET Core Routing

**Minimal API Pattern:**
- Understood `MapGet("/route", handler)` maps HTTP GET requests to handlers
- Connected this to Express.js/Fastify patterns from prior experience

### 4. LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
- Correctly interpreted `Enumerable.Range(1, 5).Select(...)` as equivalent to JavaScript's `[1,2,3,4,5].map(...)`
- Understood method chaining with `.ToArray()`

### 5. API Testing
- Successfully ran the API with `dotnet run`
- Tested endpoint using `curl`
- Correctly predicted that repeated requests return different data due to `Random.Shared.Next()`

---

## Problem-Solving Demonstrated

1. **Typo Recovery:** Caught and corrected `dotner` → `dotnet` independently
2. **Permissions Handling:** Used `sudo` when workload update required elevated privileges
3. **Curl Syntax:** Recovered from incorrect curl syntax and still achieved the goal
4. **Self-directed Discovery:** Found official .NET documentation at dotnet.microsoft.com independently

---

## Connections to Prior Knowledge

The student effectively leveraged experience with:
- **Python** - Package management concepts
- **Node.js/Express** - Server setup patterns, routing
- **TypeScript** - Type annotations, interfaces vs concrete types
- **Vue.js** - Entry point file structure (compared `Program.cs` to `App.vue`)

---

## Student Attitude & Engagement

### Emotional State
- **Energy Level:** High - Maintained focus throughout the 4-hour session
- **Curiosity:** Strong - Asked probing questions about records, LINQ, and project structure unprompted
- **Persistence:** Excellent - Recovered from typos and permission issues without frustration
- **Confidence:** Appropriately calibrated - Acknowledged unfamiliarity while trusting ability to learn

### Session Dynamics
The student approached this first .NET session with genuine curiosity rather than treating it as a chore. There was visible satisfaction when connections clicked (e.g., recognizing `.Select()` as `.map()`). No signs of frustration even when concepts were initially confusing (records). The pace felt right—neither rushed nor dragging.

### Compared to Previous Sessions
N/A - First session. This establishes a strong baseline for engagement.

---

## Historical Patterns

### Growth Since Last Session
N/A - First session

### Recurring Themes
*To be established over future sessions. Initial observations:*
- Strong pattern of connecting new concepts to prior knowledge
- Tendency toward independent exploration (found docs without prompting)

### Trajectory
Starting point established. Early indicators suggest accelerated learning is possible due to strong transfer from existing skills.

---

## Areas for Continued Learning

- HTTPS certificate trust (`dotnet dev-certs https --trust`)
- Adding custom endpoints with route parameters
- Deeper exploration of LINQ
- Understanding the `builder` pattern and dependency injection
- Project structure (`Properties/`, `appsettings.json`)

---

## Assessment

### Understanding Level

| Objective | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Install .NET SDK | ✅ Strong | Found docs independently, understood SDK vs Runtime distinction, handled permissions correctly |
| Scaffold a new Web API project | ✅ Strong | Successfully ran command, identified .csproj as package.json equivalent, explored generated files |
| Run the API and hit an endpoint | ✅ Strong | Ran server, tested with curl, understood the JSON response and why values change |

### Concerns

None. The student demonstrated solid understanding of all core objectives and was able to connect new concepts to prior knowledge effectively. Initial confusion about records (thinking they were methods) was quickly corrected through guided questioning.

---

## Summary

Strong first session with .NET. The student shows excellent ability to:
- Transfer knowledge from other frameworks
- Ask clarifying questions
- Debug independently
- Understand concepts through guided discovery rather than rote copying

---

## Path Forward

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Next Lesson:** 02 - Custom Endpoints & Route Parameters
2. **Why This:** Directly builds on `MapGet` understanding; introduces POST/PUT/DELETE which are essential for any CRUD API and the WebChat capstone
3. **Adjusted Approach:** Can move at a faster pace given strong knowledge transfer; spend less time on analogies and more on .NET-specific patterns

### Milestone Progress
- **Current Milestone:** 1 - REST API Foundation
- **Skills Completed:** 2/7 (Project scaffolding, Minimal API routing)
- **Estimated Sessions to Milestone:** 2-3 more sessions
- **On Track?** Yes - strong start, good pace

### Maintaining Positive Momentum
The student's curiosity and confidence are assets. Keep feeding that by:
- Letting them explore tangents (like project structure) rather than forcing strict lesson adherence
- Pointing to official docs and letting them discover rather than explaining everything
- Celebrating the knowledge transfer moments—they reinforce that prior experience has value

### Long-term Trajectory
If this pace continues, Milestone 1 completion is achievable within 3-4 total sessions. The capstone project (WebChat) can begin accepting real code contributions once Milestone 1 is complete—the student will have enough foundation to build a basic in-memory CRUD API for messages.

**Bottom Line:** Excellent foundation established. Ready to accelerate into the core of REST API development with high confidence of success.
