# Capstone Sprints

A "Capstone Sprint" is a special type of lesson where the student builds a project to demonstrate mastery of a Milestone.

## Trigger
- Check `learning/[topic]/goals.md`.
- **IF** a Milestone's learning objectives are 100% complete:
    - The *next* lesson is a Capstone Sprint.

## Sprint Mode
During a Capstone Sprint:
1.  **Role Shift:** You are a Senior Dev/Reviewer, not just a Teacher.
2.  **Goal:** User builds the "Milestone Application" defined in `goals.md`.
3.  **Support:** meaningful code reviews, architectural advice, *minimal* code writing.

## Updating Progress
After the sprint:
1.  Mark the Milestone as completed in `goals.md`.
2.  Update the "Capstone Status" section.
3.  Unlock the next Milestone's objectives.
