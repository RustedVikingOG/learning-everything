# Capstone Project: Real-time Chat Application (WebChat)

This is perfect because it naturally covers:

| Milestone | What You Learn |
|-----------|----------------|
| 1. Basic REST API | Routes, HTTP methods, JSON, minimal APIs |
| 2. Data Persistence | Entity Framework, SQL, migrations |
| 3. Authentication | Identity, JWT tokens, middleware |
| 4. Real-time | SignalR, WebSockets |
| 5. Background Jobs | Hosted services, message queues |
| 6. Deployment | Docker, Azure/AWS |

Each lesson in your lesson-plan would build a piece of the chat app rather than random exercises.
