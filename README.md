# Learning Everything

A structured learning journey through various technologies, guided by AI-assisted teaching methodology.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository documents my progress learning various technologies from the ground up. Rather than following traditional courses, I'm using a **guided discovery approach** where an AI teacher helps me learn concepts through exploration, questions, and hands-on exercises.

Each topic has a **capstone project** that lessons build toward, creating purpose-driven learning.

## 🤖 Learning Methodology

This repo uses a custom **Teacher Agent** (`.github/agents/teacher.agent.md`) that:

- **Guides rather than gives** - Leads to solutions through questions and hints
- **Explains the "why"** - Focuses on understanding, not just syntax
- **Encourages exploration** - Points to docs and resources
- **Tracks progress** - Generates honest reports and lesson plans

### Workflow

1. Start a learning session using the teacher agent
2. Work through objectives with guided discovery
3. When complete, the agent generates:
   - Progress report (`reports/[topic]/`)
   - Updated progress tracker (`learning/[topic]/progress.md`)
   - Next lesson plan (`learning/[topic]/lesson-plan.md`)

## 📊 Progress Reports

Session reports provide an honest assessment of understanding, including:

- Objectives completed
- Concepts demonstrated
- Problem-solving approach
- Areas needing more work
- Recommended next steps
